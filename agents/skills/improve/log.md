Append-only record of `/improve` runs. Used for regression detection, escalation, and trend analysis.

## 2026-02-26 — dots (san-jose workspace)

**Skills improved:** /improve (rewrite), /knowledge (new)
**Codebase gaps fixed:** 0
**Knowledge captured:** 0 (no knowledge base — suggested /knowledge init)
**Handoffs generated:** none (all skills local)
**New skills proposed:** /knowledge (created)
**Regressions found:** none (first run)

Changes:
- /improve: Rewrote with 9-step workflow — added skill classification (local/external), handoff prompts, codebase gap detection, knowledge capture, improvement log, regression checks, escalation logic, compounding philosophy
- /knowledge: Created new skill for managing context/knowledge/ directory with init/add/update/status subcommands
